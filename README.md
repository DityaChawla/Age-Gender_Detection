# Gender, Age Detection

This project aims to prevent catfishing on social media by verifying a user's age and gender through a live camera using Deep Learning techniques. The system will use Python, Twitter Data Collection, OpenCV (Viola Jones Algorithm), Numpy, and Matplotlib to capture and analyze a user's face during registration.
